    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Inception is a science fiction thriller directed by Christopher Nolan. The film follows Dom Cobb, a skilled thief 
        who steals secrets from within the subconscious during the dream state. Cobb is offered a chance to have his 
        criminal history erased as payment for a task considered to be impossible — "inception": planting an idea 
        into someone’s mind.
